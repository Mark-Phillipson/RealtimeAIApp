Using Real Time AI

This is a quick demo showing how to do dictation without the cursor and making AI do all the heavy lifting. The AI will take care of the cursor and the text input, so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas.

You can also edit the text afterwards or even start afresh if you change your mind.

I've made a fork of an existing repository that demonstrates this here:

The original repository is here:

The demos use Blazor server and tailwind CSS for styling. The AI is powered by OpenAI's gpt-4o-realtime-preview model.
